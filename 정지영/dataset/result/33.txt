Nicaragua's democracy is crumbling. It's been a long time coming. Actress Lisa Banes, who appeared in numerous television series and films like "Gone Girl," died Monday after suffering injuries sustained from being hit by a scooter in New York City earlier this month, the NYPD and a law enforcement official told CNN Tuesday. She was 65. "We are heartsick over Lisa's tragic and senseless passing," David Williams, her manager, said in a statement. "She was a woman of great spirit, kindness and generosity and dedicated to her work, whether on stage or in front of a camera and even more so to her wife, family and friends. We were blessed to have had her in our lives. Banes is survived by her wife, Kathryn Kranhold, who paid tribute in a touching post on Twitter. Banes suffered severe head trauma after being struck by a scooter that ran a red light in Manhattan's Upper West on June 4. She was hospitalized immediately following the incident, police said. "The scooter then fled the location, continuing north bound. There are no arrests and the investigation remains ongoing," the NYPD said in a release. Williams previously told CNN his understanding was that Banes was on her way to visit Juilliard, her alma mater, and Lincoln Center Theater when she was injured. Banes, a native of Ohio, began her acting career in the 1980s, according to IMDB. She starred alongside Tom Cruise in the 1988 film "Cocktail" and played the concerned, prickly mother Marybeth Elliott in the 2014 film "Gone Girl." Her TV appearances include roles in "Royal Pains," "Masters of Sex" and "Nashville." On stage, she has performed in the plays "High Society," "Arcadia" and "Rumors" and won a Theatre World Award for her role in "Look Back in Anger," according to Playbill.
