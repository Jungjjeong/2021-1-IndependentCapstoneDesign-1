		"Like the majority of Japan's population, he hasn't been vaccinated and doesn't know if he'll receive a dose before the pandemic-delayed Games begin on July 23.",
		"\"I love the Olympics, but I don't want to get corona,\" said Esnaashari, a language teacher from Hyogo prefecture.",
		"\"It's great to be part of something bigger than yourself, but there's a risk factor and at the current time it's very high.\"",
		"Japan is fighting a fourth wave of Covid-19 and, though the virus isn't spreading as quickly as it was in May, around 2,000 new cases are being reported each day.",
		"Just weeks away from the Olympics, fewer than 10% of Japan's population has received at least one dose.",
		"Taro Kono, Japan's vaccine minister, said Tuesday 800,000 doses are being administered daily, and the country should reach 1 million doses per day by the end of June.",
		"However, at that rate, fewer than 20% of Japan would be fully vaccinated by the time the Games begin.",
		"Games organizers plan to vaccinate 18,000 Olympic workers, including referees, staff, doping testers, and some volunteers.",
		"But with some 70,000 volunteers, there won't be enough to go around.",
		"It is not clear how many of the volunteers will get a dose.",
		"Of the 80,000 people who signed up to help at the Games, at least 10,000 have quit, mostly due to the pandemic.",
		"Esnaashari is still not sure if he'll pull out.",
		"\"If I was to go without being vaccinated, in the back of my mind I would be thinking 'am I going to get corona today, or is it going to be tomorrow?'\"",

		"Tokyo organizers say the recent withdrawal of around 10,000 volunteers in Japan won't impact operations because of other Covid-19 restrictions, including a ban on spectators meaning fewer overall numbers at the Games.",
		"When college student Jun Hatakeyama signed up to volunteer at the Tokyo Olympics, he was filled with national pride -- excited to welcome the world's best athletes to his country.",
		"But he says his enthusiasm slowly turned into anxiety and disillusionment as he witnessed one problem after another: from rising Olympic costs to sexist comments from the former head of the Tokyo Olympics, and now the decision to hold the Games from organizers barreling ahead with the event despite surging cases in Japan.",
		"Hatakeyama has quit his role to make a statement.",
		"\"The Olympic Games is belittling human lives,\" he said.",
		"\"Our lives are not normal, it's a state of emergency now.",

		"Organizers insist the Olympics can be held in a safe bubble: athletes will be regularly tested, contact traced, and socially distanced.",

		"But public health experts say there are many ways for the bubble to be punctured, especially if tens of thousands of largely unvaccinated and untested volunteers are moving between Olympic venues.",
		"\"Even without spectators, it's not a bubble.",
		"There are too many leaks in it,\" said epidemiologist Mike Toole from the Burnet Institute in Melbourne, Australia.",
		"\"Having these 70,000 volunteers out in the community, moving from neighborhood to neighborhood, then going into the Games -- where you have around 20% unvaccinated -- then you're looking at a high-risk scenario.\"",

		"The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association, an organization representing 6,000 doctors in Tokyo, wrote a letter calling for the Games to be canceled.",
		"\"The most important priority now is to fight against COVID-19 and to secure people's lives and livelihoods,\" the letter said.",
		"\"Japan will bear a big responsibility if the hosting of the Olympic and Paralympic Games contributes to the spread of COVID-19 and increases the number of sufferers and deaths.\"",

		"Rolling out the vaccines As the Olympics fast approaches, Japan is ramping up its vaccination plan.",
		"But even if the country had the capacity to administer 1 million doses a day from tomorrow, it still faces the challenge of encouraging people to take the vaccine.",
		"The rollout began in February with people aged 65 and over, but so far only around a third of all senior citizens have been vaccinated.",
		"Kono, the vaccine minister, acknowledged some people were reluctant to show their arm, and indicated part of the process would be encouraging people to take the shots.",
		"\"As it goes down, we are trying to reach younger generations; more and more people are not interested in vaccines, so how can we encourage them to get vaccinated,\" Kono said.",
		"Large-scale coronavirus vaccination sites run by the state in Tokyo and Osaka will begin offering shots to younger people from across the country on Thursday, according to Japanese state broadcaster NHK.",
		"Vaccinations are due to start at workplaces and universities next week, though some companies, such as Japanese airline ANA have started early.",
		"Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga wants everyone who desires the vaccine to receive it by October or November.",
		"Still, with five weeks to go before the start of the Olympics, the pressure is on to ensure the public that Tokyo is safe.",
		"Language teacher Esnaashari said he was planning to stay with friends in the capital during the Olympics.",
		"Before the pandemic, he said they were willing, \"but now it's like, 'Do I want to live with someone interacting with possibly thousands of people a day?'\"",
		"\"At the very minimum, I would prefer if they're able to house the volunteers in designated hotels and give them the proper shuttle buses to the venues,\" he said.",

		"It's easy to see why, with doctors pleading on social media for resources to be made available, and families queuing up outside hospitals, praying for a bed -- if they're lucky, maybe one with oxygen support.",
		"But as a clear, steep shortage of resources has doubled the devastation of this second wave, the systemic failings of India's central and state governments to provide quality care is no longer just being discussed in hushed tones in hospital corridors.",

		"These eruptions, called coronal mass ejections, blast out solar particles across the solar system and have the potential to disrupt technology if they reach Earth.",
		"These eruptions were detected by multiple instruments on the spacecraft during a close flyby of the sun, which is called a perihelion, on February 10.",
		"This flyby brought the spacecraft within 46.5 million miles of the sun -- that's half the distance between the massive star and Earth.",
		"This is the first time the orbiter has witnessed such eruptions.",
		"The mission, which launched in February 2020, is a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency.",
		"Although Solar Orbiter's main scientific agenda doesn't begin until November -- to study the sun's north and south poles -- it has already made close passes by the sun that captured the closest images ever taken of our star and revealed \"campfires\" near its surface.",
		"Currently the spacecraft is in its cruise phase, which allows for calibration of some of the 10 instruments aboard.",
		"During the cruise phase, four of its instruments are up and running and have been since launch.",
		"The February flyby presented mission teams with an opportunity to conduct observations and test out some of their instruments.",
		"Once the scientific mission begins in earnest, all 10 instruments will work together to create joint observations of our sun.",
		"This flyby was unique in that the spacecraft was actually behind the sun from the perspective of Earth, causing a lag in data transfer rates.",
		"This delayed the data's delivery to mission scientists, so some of it is still being analyzed.",
		"The mission team wasn't expecting Solar Orbiter to record any data as it passed behind the sun and looped back around in orbit on the other side, so capturing these eruptions was a happy accident.",
		"So far, the data tells an interesting tale.",
		"During the flyby, three of the spacecraft's instruments all registered a pair of coronal mass ejections.",
		"These tools included the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), the Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI) and the Metis coronagraph.",
		"Meanwhile, other spacecraft like ESA's Proba-2 and the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory both witnessed these events from the Earth-facing side of the sun.",
		"A NASA mission called STEREO-A also spied the event from a different perspective.",
		"The instruments on Solar Orbiter, as well as data collected by the other missions, shows a sudden eruption of particles from the sun, occurring in tandem with a visibly bright burst.",
		"Tracking space weather Understanding coronal mass ejections is key to decoding space weather, which is activity from the sun that can cause impacts on Earth.",
		"These can affect astronauts on the space station in low-Earth orbit, as well as satellites that support global communications.",

		"Understanding the sun's magnetic field and solar wind are key, because they contribute to space weather.",
		"The sun's magnetic field is so massive that it stretches beyond Pluto, providing a pathway for solar wind to travel directly across the solar system.",

		"It launched in August 2018 and will eventually come within 4 million miles of the sun -- the closest a spacecraft has ever flown by our star.",
		"The Parker probe is \"tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind; determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind; and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles,\" according to NASA.",
		"Together, the missions can help unlock the mysteries of the sun and provide more data to researchers than either could accomplish on its own.",

		"According to a statement obtained by Xinhua News Agency, China's General Administration of Sport says it has suspended the only permission that allows a company to organize climbing activities from the Tibetan side.",
		"The cancellation is made to prevent \"import of coronavirus,\" the statement reads.",
		"A total of 21 Chinese climbers had obtained climbing permits in the spring climbing season of 2021 before the cancellation, according to the agency.",
		"On May 9, Chinese state media reported that the country was planning to set up a \"line of separation\" at the summit of Mount Everest to avoid climbers from the Nepali side mingling with those ascending from the Tibetan side, as a way to deter the spread of the coronavirus.",
		"Coronavirus cases have been rising rapidly in Nepal.",
		"The country reported over 8,000 new coronavirus cases on Friday, according to the Nepal Ministry of Health, and roughly 20% of Nepal's total cases since the pandemic began were reported in the last 10 days.",

		"This new guidance speaks not only to the effectiveness of the vaccines, but also the trust major medical and public health organizations have placed in them.",
		"They believe that when the story of this pandemic is finally written, it will be about the vaccines -- and the science behind them -- that finally rescued us.",
		"My colleagues at CNN and I have been watching the vaccine development story unfold since the very start.",
		"Over the last year, we have followed research teams on five continents, documenting their trials and tribulations, their triumphs as well as the crushing defeats.",
		"We know how the story began, with the outbreak in Wuhan, China, and we know how it ends, with some of the most effective vaccines in the history of the world.",
		"Now, the behind-the-scenes story of this all-consuming race is being told for the first time in the documentary \"Race for the Vaccine,\" premiering tonight night on CNN.",
		"On your marks\u202f On January 10, 2020, researchers in China -- where the first cases of an unusual pneumonia were documented -- released the entire genetic sequence for the novel coronavirus that appeared to be behind this mystery illness.",
		"This action -- a simple post on a website used by virologists to share research and data -- was like firing a starting gun, and it was heard by scientists 'round the world.",
		"In Australia, Keith Chappell and his team at the University of Queensland jumped into action to develop a tried-and-true protein vaccine.",
		"In the United Kingdom, Professor Teresa Lambe from the University of Oxford, got started immediately on a viral vector vaccine.",
		"In China, George Gao, director general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, directed his team to focus on what is considered one of the oldest types of immunization technology: an inactivated vaccine.",
		"And, two teams -- one in the United States at the National Institutes of Health, and the other in Germany at a small company called BioNTech -- placed all-or-nothing bets on an approach that very few had ever heard of, even in the scientific community: messenger RNA.",
		"When we started filming this documentary, we had no idea how long the race would take, or whether there would even be a winner.",
		"Remember, before the pandemic, in the United States creating an FDA-approved vaccine often took more than a decade.",
		"This documentary chronicles the lives of the remarkable scientists who, under enormous pressure, did whatever it took to get these vaccines to the starting gate and over the finish line.",
		"It explains why certain gambles were taken and follows how their choices unfolded.",
		"A vaccine is born Truth be told, all of the coronavirus vaccines got their start a long time before January 2020: The so-called platforms -- the underlying technology -- all existed before the pandemic, and all but one -- the mRNA platform -- had already been used commercially in the past.",
		"All of the vaccine makers had the same goal: create the best delivery system\u202fin order to trigger the strongest immune response.",
		"It's that immune response that prepares our body so it can defend itself when it encounters the real virus later on.",
		"That might mean using the whole virus itself, or a weakened version of it.",
		"It may mean using just a piece of the virus, or only the blueprint of a viral portion, to teach the body to recognize something foreign, and then attack it.",
		"If you have heard anything about the Covid-19 vaccines, you have probably heard the term spike protein.",
		"Think of them as the little nubs that protrude from the surface of the coronavirus and give it its crown-like appearance.",
		"Crown -- or corona, in Latin -- is where this virus gets its name.",
		"The spike protein is what the virus uses to latch onto and break into our cells, which it then hijacks to replicate itself.",
		"Viral vector vaccines such as Johnson & Johnson (Janssen), AstraZeneca/Oxford, and Russia's Sputnik V use another virus -- in this case, a common cold virus -- to deliver instructions to make the spike protein, which our cells then display on their surface, triggering an immune response.",
		"Protein subunit vaccines -- such as Novavax and Sanofi -- use genetically engineered insect viruses to infect moths, whose cells then produce the pieces of coronavirus spike protein.",
		"These are harvested and made into a vaccine, which is then injected into people.",
		"The oldest vaccine technology -- using the whole, killed virus to trigger an immune response -- is the approach used by China's Sinovac.",
		"On the other end of the spectrum, the newest type of vaccine technology is the mRNA vaccine.",
		"This method uses mRNA -- messenger RNA -- to give our cells the instructions to make a piece of the spike protein.",
		"Our cells then make that protein over and over again, which then stimulates our immune system to react.",
		"It's the technology used by BioNTech, which teamed up with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, as well as Moderna, which worked with scientists at the NIH.",
		"The story behind mRNA technology Many people describe mRNA technology as new, but that is not entirely true.",
		"While no mRNA medicine or therapeutic had ever been authorized by the FDA, the science behind the mRNA vaccines is based on concepts developed more than 20 years ago by Dr. Drew Weissman and Katalin Karik\u00f3, both at the University of Pennsylvania at the time.",
		"During those 20 years, mRNA vaccines have been studied and tested for conditions such as the flu, Zika and rabies, to name a few.",
		"\"DNA is the genetic code.",
		"It contains everything that makes our body and makes our body work.",
		"What RNA does, RNA makes a copy of genes -- genes usually encode a protein -- so the RNA makes a copy of one protein from the DNA and carries it out to a machine in the cell that makes proteins off of that RNA copy,\" Weissman explained to me back in December.",
		"\"We're using the body as our protein production factory.\"",
		"Weissman said that even two decades ago, they were thinking of using mRNA technology for vaccines, as well as for therapeutic proteins, for gene editing and other applications.",
		"Among the early adapters to study and use mRNA technology is the husband and wife team Dr. U\u011fur \u015eahin and Dr. \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci.",
		"The couple, when they first met, bonded over science -- so much so, they headed straight back to the lab after their wedding.",
		"\"We have worked hands-on and seen patients and treated patients, and at the same time we were scientists.",
		"And what we were basically daily experiencing, as cancer doctors, was that there's not much we can offer our patients in terms of approved standards of care,\" \u015eahin said on my podcast back in March.",
		"\"Yet in the world of science, we experienced that there were so many technologies and knowledge which would provide the opportunity to better treat patients.",
		"And this gap and the interest in translating science into survival was what we shared and why at some point we decided to do this journey together,\" he said.",
		"The pair founded BioNTech in 2008, which at the time was focused mainly on using new technologies for cancer therapies.",
		"But then in 2020, clouds began gathering on the horizon.",
		"Even as early as January, \u015eahin thought the situation might develop into a pandemic, and he felt he and his wife had the tools to help.",
		"In March, BioNTech quickly teamed up with Pfizer, a company they had already been working with on other projects.",
		"The other team working on an mRNA vaccine, Moderna, was an upstart company that had never brought an FDA-approved product to market.",
		"The company, whose name is a portmanteau of \"Modified\" and \"RNA,\" worked in partnership with the NIH's Dr. Barney Graham and Kizzmekia Corbett, an immunologist.",
		"Asked during an online interview Wednesday if he felt the pressure, Graham said the Vaccine Research Center, of which he is deputy director, had been under pressure before -- for example, during the Ebola and Zika crises.",
		"\"In this case, we started this project before it was a pandemic.",
		"So at the beginning, for us, it was a demonstration project to prove how fast we could go if the need arose.",
		"...",
		"It didn't turn into a lot of pressure until the middle of March, when it was declared a pandemic and when we started having a lot more cases around the globe,\" he said.",
		"Hitting the jackpot As the months of 2020 ticked by, the scientists worked almost nonstop to perfect, then test their products.",
		"And then the results started coming in.",
		"They were almost too good to be true: Early study results showed the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 95% effective, and the Moderna vaccine was 94.1% effective, at preventing symptomatic Covid-19.",
		"These preliminary numbers held up as more study results came in.",
		"At the start of the summer, the FDA had said it would require any coronavirus vaccine to be at least 50% effective to win approval (keep in mind that the flu vaccine is between 40% and 60% in years with a good match between circulating virus and the vaccine).",
		"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who was then on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said he would settle for a vaccine that was 70%-75% effective.",
		"But the mRNA vaccines results blew all that away.",
		"Just last week, a close friend and board member at the CDC told me, \"The creators of the mRNA vaccines will likely be nominated for\u202fthe Nobel prize.\"",
		"After a rapid race to the end, it was the two mRNA vaccines that crossed the finish line first and second in the United States, winning FDA emergency use authorization a week apart, in mid-December.",
		"It was just 11 months after the genetic sequence had first been shared with the world.",
		"To reach herd immunity globally, though, all of the vaccines that make it across the finish line have a very important role to play.",
		"There will be billions of people immunized around the world, and there is a possibility that boosters will be necessary in the future as well.",
		"The thing about races is that they force the impossible: They make us better, safer and, yes, faster than we have ever been before.",
		"And this race for a vaccine, under the brutal pressure of a pandemic, may have forever accelerated the pace of medical innovation by showing us exactly how creative, nimble and determined humankind can be."

		"The genre-bending approach to this AMC series (which already premiered on its streaming service) proves bracing in the pilot episode, as Allison (\"Schitt's Creek's\" Annie Murphy) smiles along during the sitcom portion with husband Kevin (Eric Petersen), a doughy, sports-loving Neanderthal who treats her like little more than a nagging maid.",

		"Sheila almost literally stumbles into an exercise class run by Bunny (Della Saba), whose boyfriend Tyler (Lou Taylor Pucci) produces videos on the side that run toward the exotic.",

		"Thursday's opinion is further evidence that the 71-year-old justice who has served on the court since 2006, wants the new conservative majority -- buoyed with President Donald Trump's three nominees -- to swing big.",

		"\"By choosing to privilege a novel constitutional right over the religious liberty interests explicitly protected in the First Amendment, and by doing so undemocratically, the Court has created a problem that only it can fix,\" they concluded.",

		"One of those, he said, was with respect to religious liberty.",
		"\"Take a quick look at the Constitution,\" he said, you will see the \"free exercise clause of the First Amendment which protects religious liberty.\"",

		"\"It's the fact that the city can't stand the message that Catholic Social Services and the Archdiocese are sending by continuing to adhere to the old-fashioned view about marriage.",
		"Isn't that the case?\"",

Smith, that holds that if a legal requirement applies equally to everyone -- including religious organizations -- it is constitutional as long as the government has a rational basis for the law, even if it burdens religious practice.",
		"And although the justices rarely directly overturn precedent, Alito said that Smith was \"ripe for reexamination.\"",
		"\"Even if a rule serves no important purpose and has a devastating effect on religious freedom, the Constitution, according to Smith provides no protection,\" he said.",

		"But instead, Roberts had focused on the details of the city's contract that allowed exemptions and held that the agency deserved such an exemption.",
		"\"This decision might as well be written on the dissolving paper sold in magic shops,\" Alito complained.",
		"All the city has to do, he said, was to remove the language about exemptions.",
		"\"If it does that, then voila, today's decision will vanish,\" he said, and noted that the decision provides \"no guidance\" regarding similar controversies in other jurisdictions.",

		"Go to the address for Cyber Ninjas' Legal Department, listed on its audit contract with the Arizona Senate, and you'll wind up at a rented mailbox in a UPS Store in Sarasota, Florida.",
		"The company's business address registered with Florida's Secretary of State, also in Sarasota, was sold last December, and now sits empty.",
		"Logan himself has strenuously avoided speaking to reporters since taking part in an April 22 press conference just before the audit began.",
		"At that conference, he refused to answer questions about how he'd repeated and amplified various debunked election-fraud conspiracy theories on social media, such as this retweet unearthed by the Arizona Mirror, for example: \"I'm tired of hearing people say there was no fraud.",
		"It happened, it's real, and people better get wise fast.\"",
		"He'd also provided, in a Michigan election lawsuit, an affidavit alleging vulnerabilities in one county's system for tallying votes; state and county officials disagreed, identified a slew of problems with the analysis.",
		"And Logan repeated disproven claims in a paper he wrote for Republican US senators objecting to Congress's Jan. 6 certification of President Joe Biden's election win.",
		"But Logan, and the Arizona Senate's audit liaison, Ken Bennett, argued at that press conference that Logan's own opinions don't matter, and that people should trust in the integrity of the audit process he's overseeing.",
		"Logan declined interview requests from CNN.",
		"An emailed statement from his spokesman, Rod Thomson, stated that \"Mr. Logan recognizes President Biden's results were certified and accepted in accordance with the Constitution.",
		"Mr. Logan remains committed to restoring integrity and trust into our election system, which he is demonstrating through the work he is performing here in Maricopa County.\"",
		"But that's a tough sell, even to Logan's friends.",
		"\"It's hard to say anything bad about the guy.",
		"He's a lovely person.",
		"He's just nuts now,\" said Tony Summerlin, who has been friends with Logan for 15 years, and said he helped him win a cybersecurity contract with the Federal Communications Commission five years ago.",
		"\"It's scary; because if someone like him can turn into this, who can't turn into this?\"",
		"Summerlin said that in all the years he'd known Logan, before the Arizona audit, \"we never, never had a single political conversation; that's what stunned me about this...",
		"He said, 'there's definitely something there.'",
		"I said, 'based on what?'",
		"He said, 'it'll come.'",
		"I said, 'you sound like the My Pillow guy.'\"",
		"Another friend of Logan, who asked not to be named because she works with both Republicans and Democrats in Washington, DC, and feared blowback from being linked to him, described him as very smart, very competent in cybersecurity, and politically na\u00efve.",
		"\"Doug may not have thought it all the way through,\" she said.",
		"Logan, 41, graduated from Guilford College in Greensboro, N.C., in 2002, and quickly became involved in cybersecurity work.",
		"Summerlin said he first met Logan in 2005 or 2006.",
		"\"He was in DC trying to get business with the government for his firm, which at that point was him.",
		"He seemed like a smart guy.\"",
		"In 2010, in New York, Logan competed in the first US Cyber Challenge, a national program to identify and develop cybersecurity talent.",
		"He went on to become a Cyber Challenge instructor, and helped develop a workshop for the curriculum, according to a person familiar with his work at the program.",
		"In March 2014, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported that Sarasota County's Economic Development Corporation was helping Logan relocate his company, Cyber Ninjas, to the city, \"with plans to eventually add eight to 10 employees.\"",
		"The paper said Logan was moving there from Bloomington, Indiana, where he'd also worked for the software security company Cigital.",
		"Logan and his company have a trail of positive reviews posted on his LinkedIn page for cybersecurity consulting work in the private sector.",
		"He and Cyber Ninjas also received a three-year, $101,000 federal cybersecurity contract with the Federal Communications Commission in 2016, and subsequently, Summerlin said, worked for the Universal Services Administrative Company, a private-public partnership under the FCC that provides broadband services to underserved communities and schools, among other work.",
		"None of that previous consulting appears to have any ties to election-related matters.",
		"In April 2020, Cyber Ninjas received a Covid assistance loan for $98,322, saying in its application it then had five employees.",
		"Logan, in materials for a cybersecurity conference in Chicago last November, described himself as a father of 11 children and a \"Follower of Jesus Christ.\"",
		"But also in November, within days of Trump's election loss, Logan was messaging Ron Watkins.",
		"The recent HBO documentary \"Q: Into the Storm,\" pointed to Watkins as either being \"Q\" or at least a key promulgator of the QAnon conspiracy theories that helped animate many of those who stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6.",
		"Watkins is the former administrator of the internet message-board website 8chan, now 8kun, effectively QAnon's home base.",
		"In a series of archived tweets from a now-deleted account between Nov. 12 and December, first reported by The Daily Beast, Logan messaged Watkins, \"I'd love to chat if you have a chance;\" asked Watkins for links to \"original source documents;\" and tagged Watkins on his exchanges with attorneys Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, who filed numerous lawsuits challenging Biden's victory and baselessly claiming electoral fraud.",
		"Wood also told a reporter for Talking Points Memo that Logan had visited his home in South Carolina to meet with others \"working on the investigation into election fraud.\"",
		"Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, who hired Cyber Ninjas, dismissed concerns about Logan's tweets and other indications he might be biased as \"tiny little things.\"",
		"Some others don't see them as quite so tiny.",
		"Douglas Cobb, owner of Paper Forensics, a Savannah, Georgia-based document examination firm, shared emails with CNN showing he was approached in April by another Cyber Ninjas subcontractor, Haystack Investigations, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, to join the Arizona \"audit.\"",
		"The emails were first reported by the Arizona Republic.",
		"Cobb said he was asked to provide up to 20 people for 14 days to examine the ballot paper, at a rate of $600 a day plus expenses per person and $800 a day for himself.",
		"That total, just over $179,000 plus expenses, is more than the Arizona Senate contracted to pay Cyber Ninjas for the audit as a whole: $150,000.",
		"As CNN has reported, private partisan sources heavily invested in casting doubt on Biden's election victory claim to have funneled more than $1.6 million to the audit.",
		"Neither Fann, nor the Senate, nor Logan, have said how much in private funding Cyber Ninjas has received or spent.",
		"At the April 22 press conference, Logan said he didn't know how much his company was being paid, and didn't want to know, because \"I don't want to be influenced.\"",
		"Cobb had planned to work on the audit -- until his son looked online into the people he'd be working for.",
		"\"I withdrew once I found out a little more about who was involved, Cyber Ninjas and Logan and his conspiracy theories,\" Cobb said.",
		"Logan didn't answer questions from CNN about who is accounting for funds received and spent for the audit; about whether he's been approached by legislators from other states to do similar work; about whether his company has an actual office or any full-time employees; about how he and his company came to Fann's attention; or about whether he still believes the conspiracies he touted months ago to GOP US senators, such as debunked allegations of fraud in counties in Georgia and Pennsylvania, or debunked claims that Dominion Voting System's core software originates from intellectual property of Smartmatic, and is linked through Smartmatic to Venezuela's long-dead former president Hugo Chavez, among others.",
		"Questions about Logan's beliefs continue to surface.",
		"On June 3, when conspiracy theorist and Overstock founder Patrick Byrne released a trailer for a film about the Arizona audit, claiming the election was stolen from Trump, several Arizona reporters immediately pointed to an anonymous speaker, identified only as an \"ANON, Application Security Analyst,\" as sounding exactly like Doug Logan.",
		"Summerlin, too, said he recognized Logan's voice.",
		"On the trailer, the speaker says, \"if we don't fix our election integrity now, we may no longer have a democracy.\"",
		"Shortly after several reporters tweeted about Logan and the trailer, a re-edited version of the trailer was substituted on YouTube with the voice for that speaker digitally altered.",
		"Logan didn't respond to queries about whether that was his voice on the trailer, which has now been removed for violating YouTube's community guidelines.",
		"The last time he spoke publicly about the audit, on April 22, Logan told reporters, \"I know you guys want to paint me like some bad guy in here.",
		"I'm involved in this and putting everything on the line with my company because I care about our country.",
		"...",
		"Otherwise, who would be stupid enough to walk into this?",
		"Every individual that walks into any election integrity thing gets butchered by everybody.\"",
		"Summerlin said Logan recently contacted him to ask for his help, saying that the Universal Service Administrative Company had terminated Cyber Ninjas' contract.",
		"Neither Logan nor the USAC responded to questions from CNN about the alleged contract termination.",
		"\"He said, 'it's wrong they're terminating me,'\" Summerlin said.",
		"\"I said, 'don't be an idiot, of course they're terminating your ass, you work at will.'",
		"I said, 'if you get a government contract any time after this, I'll be amazed.\""

		"But he still has a telephone!",
		"And that means he can, whenever he wants, call into friendly outlets to spout his latest, um, observations on the state of the country and world.",
		"Which is what he did on Wednesday night, chatting with Fox News' Sean Hannity about, well, everything.",
		"Below the lines you need to see.",
		"1.",
		"\"Well, I guess the overall is, we didn't get anything.",
		"We gave a very big stage to Russia, and we got nothing.\"",
		"This is Trump's analysis of President Joe Biden's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
		"Which is sort of ironic because when Trump got together with Putin in Helsinki in 2018, he undermined America's intelligence community by saying that \"both sides\" were to blame for Russia interfering in the 2016 election.",
		"And away we go!",
		"2.",
		"\"And performance art, you will take a look at how various people performed, namely, the two people.",
		"And you have to form your own judgment.",
		"It's not for me to say.\"",

		"4.",
		"\"Look, for five years, from the day I came down the escalator, we have been under investigation, and it turned out to be all false stuff.",
		"It was a terrible thing with the 'Russia, Russia, Russia,' which actually made it difficult to deal with Russia.\"",
		"Just to be clear here: Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation did not conclude that the allegations against Trump and his 2020 campaign were \"all false stuff.\"",
		"Here's exactly what Mueller wrote: \"(I)f we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.",
		"Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment.",
		"...",
		"Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\"",
		"5.",

		"When I mentioned that, it was like a firestorm.",
		"Hydroxychloroquine, now great reviews are coming out on that.\"",
		"While the Biden administration has said that the possibility exists that the coronavirus originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, neither it nor anyone in the scientific community has said that's where the virus definitively originated.",

		"\"I got along really well with [Putin].",
		"Nobody was tougher on Russia, he would say that.",

		"Just a reminder: The Mueller report, as well as the Senate Intelligence Committee, concluded that Russia meddled in the election to help Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton because they believed the billionaire businessman would be better for their interests.",
