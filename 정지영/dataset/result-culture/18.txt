Moderates win the day in close vote over Southern Baptist presidency. The gender-fluid Nigerian clothing label Lagos Space Programme was founded by non-binary designer Adeju Thompson in 2018. The label's garments are inspired by African heritage design and queer culture. Lagos Space Programme applies adire, a traditional Yoruba indigo resist-dyeing practice, to contemporary knitwear pieces. Thompson calls this method "post adire." Thompson's designs tie together heritage styles with playful queer iconography in a marriage of traditional and contemporary. Lagos Space Programme's spring-summer 2021 collection debuted at Milan Fashion Week this January. Lagos Fashion Collective is set to show its new collection at the Milan Fashion Week, in September. Thompson's designs will feature in the Africa Fashion Exhibition at London's Victoria and Albert Museum in June 2022. Thompson, 30, grew up in Lagos and has always lived in Nigeria, bar a stint studying fashion design in the UK. Thompson says: "I want Lagos Space Programme to champion conversations around gender, indigenous knowledge and highlighting an alternate narrative around the African experience."
