		"When Covid-19 became a pandemic last year, the race was on to find any treatment that could help against the novel virus that gravely sickened and even killed some, while leaving others completely unscathed.",
		"One option was developing new medications that specifically targeted SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, from scratch.",
		"New treatments, such as monoclonal antibodies, are the result of those efforts.",
		"But developing, testing and then getting approval from the FDA, not to mention creating the infrastructure for the production and distribution of a new medication, all takes time -- time the world didn't, and still doesn't, have.",
		"Other researchers quickly began to look around at what was already on hand, in hospitals and pharmacies, and on drug store shelves.",
		"\"The advantage of drug repurposing is that that drug is already approved.",
		"It's already gone through the regulatory process to show that it's safe and effective for something.",
		"So if you can find additional uses for that drug, you already know there's a good safety profile,\" explained Dr. David Fajgenbaum, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania, and the director of the Center for Cytokine Storm Treatment and Laboratory.",
		"Not to mention: Cheap, generic versions of many older medications exist because their patents have expired.",
		"\"It's just a matter of matching the right drug to the right disease,\" Fajgenbaum said.",
		"\"Thankfully, there are over 2,000 drugs that are already approved by the FDA for at least one disease, and we've learned that there are many other diseases that those drugs can also be repurposed for.\"",
		"In fact, Fajgenbaum said he has \"dedicated [his] life towards advancing drug repurposing\" for diseases without specific treatments.",
		"His passion is driven in part by his own experience.",
		"In 2010, while in medical school, he first became ill with Castleman disease, a rare autoimmune disorder that, like Covid-19, can trigger the immune system to suddenly flood the body with inflammatory chemicals in a so-called cytokine storm; the result can be tissue and organ damage, and sometimes death.",
		"Castleman disease brought Fajgenbaum close to death five times -- until he found his own treatment in a repurposed drug.",
		"\"I'm actually alive today because of a drug that was developed 30 years ago for another condition that we identified through a very systematic process and we thought it could help to save my life,\" he said.",
		"\"Here I am, over seven years later.\"",
		"During the time he was sick, he founded the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network, a global initiative devoted to fighting Castleman disease.",
		"CDCN's collaborative method for organizing medical research later became a model for other diseases without treatments.",
		"A blueprint to save lives When Covid-19 emerged, Fajgenbaum realized that he was perfectly positioned to look for repurposed drugs to fight it.",
		"On March 13, 2020, the day when much of the country began to shut down, \"I found myself that night sitting next to my wife, hoping and praying that some researchers somewhere would follow the blueprint that we went through to identify this drug that saved my life,\" he said.",

		"He tapped his team at the Center for Cytokine Storm Treatment and Laboratory.",
		"\"I turned to my team and said, 'This is a disease that has many similarities to Castleman disease.",
		"You've experienced doing systematic drug repurposing, and frankly I'm alive today because of it.",
		"Let's apply this approach to Covid,' \" he said.",
		"With that, they launched the CORONA project (Fajgenbaum is its director and lead investigator), one of many global efforts (both private and governmental) trying to identify, trial and/or track promising treatments among existing drugs for Covid-19.",
		"His lab assembled a team of volunteers to systematically go through \"all reported cases of any drug being given to any human with Covid-19,\" and pulling all the information into one database, one central repository.",
		"\"Initially we thought there might be maybe a couple of dozen drugs that would be trialed.",
		"It's incredible -- there have now been over 400 different drugs, given to patients with Covid-19,\" he said, noting that the number of patients involved is approximately 270,000.",
		"Fajgenbaum explained that several approaches can be used to make the match between a disease and a potential treatment.",
		"They include translational research, which involves finding out what goes wrong on the cellular level with a given disease and seeing if there is an existing drug that fixes the problem.",
		"There's also high throughput drug screening, which is basically testing different drugs in a petri dish with patients' cells and seeing what happens.",
		"Artificial intelligence can also be used to find previously unknown connections between disease processes and medications.",
		"\"But at the end of the day, really the only way to know if one of these drugs that looks promising in the lab actually works in humans, is to give it to humans and to see how well those patients do,\" he said.",
		"Testing medications to treat Covid-19 in a trial is critical and tricky.",
		"Since people can get better without medication (unlike, say, Castleman disease or pancreatic cancer), it's important to conduct randomized, controlled trials, where patients are randomly selected to get the active drug or a placebo; otherwise it's hard to know if patients would have gotten better on their own anyway.",
		"This country's experience with hydroxychloroquine is a case study of what happens when hype gets ahead of the science.",
		"Based on early, often observational studies, many believed that the anti-malarial drug (itself repurposed as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis) would help treat people with Covid-19, or maybe prevent them from getting infected or sick.",
		"But when the results of randomized, controlled trials came back, the drug was shown to be ineffective.",
		"Getting the timing of drug administration right is also important.",
		"A great example, Fajgenbaum said, is dexamethasone, an inexpensive steroid that has been around for decades and is used to treat many conditions, from inflammatory arthritis to skin, eye and breathing issues.",
		"\"Amazingly, one-third of patients on ventilators, their lives are saved if you give them dexamethasone.",
		"It's a huge benefit.",
		"It also is helpful in patients who are not yet on ventilators, preventing them from having to get onto ventilators.",
		"Interestingly, dexamethasone is actually harmful if it's given too early in the disease course.",
		"So taking it when you're recently diagnosed actually is going to be harmful for you, which highlights how complicated Covid-19 is,\" he said.",
		"If researchers don't get the timing right, study results can also be inconclusive or contradictory, which can be confusing and frustrating.",
		"One example is tocilizumab.",
		"Several studies have shown it helps patients survive, and several others have shown it doesn't.",
		"The key appears to be timing.",
		"For it to work, it appears it needs be given within 24 hours of a patient being admitted to the intensive care unit.",
		"\"This isn't a disease where there's going to be one size fits all, one drug that is uniformly effective.",
		"In fact, there could be different drugs given during different stages of the disease course,\" he said.",
		"Other drugs that Fajgenbaum said appear to show promise are baricitinib, which like dexamethasone and tocilizumab also suppresses the immune response and is approved for rheumatoid arthritis, the gout drug colchicine, the blood thinner heparin and intravenous immunoglobulin.",
		"Helping critically ill patients survive is one important part of the puzzle.",
		"Another is preventing infected patients from getting so ill in the first place.",
		"That is where one of the real needs lie, said Fajgenbaum.",
		"\"I think we really need to focus on ... those patients who are newly diagnosed and prevent them from needing to be hospitalized in the first place.",
		"That's a tough population to do trials in ... because in these patients' cases, though they're not showing symptoms, they all were first infected five to 14 days ago,\" he said, noting that antivirals are unlikely to be effective so far along into the disease course.",
		"One drug he said is looking promising for helping patients avoid hospitalization is fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is used to treat depression.",
		"It decreases inflammation in the brain.",
		"A couple of early studies have found it helps keep newly infected people out of the hospital.",
		"One benefit of fluvoxamine is that, unlike monoclonal antibodies which need to be infused, it's a pill.",
		"No 'home runs' yet Dr. David Boulware, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota, has been involved in a number of different trials looking at repurposed medications for Covid-19, including a series of trials on hydroxychloroquine.",
		"\"These are really inexpensive available medicines, which is exactly why we should be studying [them], because they're really inexpensive and they're available,\" he said.",
		"Now Boulware is involved in a multi-center trial on fluvoxamine.",
		"But it's been challenging, he says, because the trial has to recruit newly-infected patients as early as possible.",
		"So far, he says they have about 300 people enrolled out of the 1,000 needed.",
		"\"So it's been relatively slow.",
		"...",
		"If we had 500 people enrolled over the next week, we'd be done in two to three weeks and we'd have a definitive answer,\" he said.",

		"\"They're generic medicines, so there's no patent on them.",

		"There's no big pharmaceutical company behind that to push that forward,\" he said.",
		"He says it's really up to private donors or the federal government to support the research, since there is no profit incentive for pharmaceutical companies to do so.",

		"Data from the company's large-scale Phase 3 clinical trial of the vaccine in the US and Mexico are expected this month, but the timeline depends on how quickly it accumulates data on the prevalence of disease in trial areas.",
		"The company's vaccine against Covid-19 has been a year in the making, Dr. Gregory Glenn, president of research and development for Novavax, told CNN.",
		"The work began even before the world realized it faced a pandemic.",
		"In January of last year, Glenn and his colleagues were closely watching an unusual cluster of pneumonia reported in China.",
		"They wondered whether that outbreak could be due to another version or recurrence of the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS.",
		"\"It occurred to us that this just might be 'SARS 2,' \" Glenn said.",
		"\"The sequence was published on the Internet, the genetic sequence for the virus -- and we could see it was a coronavirus.",
		"Then we kicked into action.\"",
		"How Novavax's vaccine works -- using moth cells When the sequence published online, scientists around the world quickly identified the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, as a coronavirus because it has what are called \"spike proteins\" on its surface.",
		"These spikes form large protrusions, giving coronaviruses the appearance of wearing crowns.",
		"Corona is the Latin word for \"crown.\"",
		"These knob-shaped structures are what the virus uses to connect to human cells, causing infection.",
		"Getting the immune system to recognize and \"remember\" those spike proteins is key in how a vaccine helps protect against Covid-19.",
		"Yet the way various coronavirus vaccines do that can vary.",
		"Novavax's coronavirus vaccine, called NVX-CoV2373, differs from the three vaccines already being distributed in the United States.",
		"The vaccine relies on what is called recombinant nanoparticle technology and Novavax's adjuvant, called Matrix-M, to stimulate an immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies.",
		"When the genetic sequence for the coronavirus was published, Novavax scientists identified the gene for the spike protein and created a modified version of that gene.",
		"The researchers cloned the genes into a baculovirus that infects insects.",
		"They then infected moth cells -- specifically, cells from the fall armyworm insect -- with that virus, prompting them to produce the coronavirus spike protein.",
		"These virus-like nanoparticles were harvested to make Novavax's vaccine.",
		"\"The whole idea of the vaccine is to show the immune system something that looks, tastes and acts like a virus, with the exception that it doesn't make you sick.",
		"So we made the spike protein.",
		"We put it in a particle -- basically, like a soap bubble -- and it's the size of the virus,\" Glenn said.",
		"\"It's not infectious.",
		"We never touch the coronavirus itself,\" he added.",
		"\"Then that is given to people, and they make an immune response that's very much focused just on the spike -- and I would say, the hallmark of our vaccine is it gives a very strong immune response with very few side effects, and the dose is very small and the vaccine can be stored with normal refrigerated temperatures.\"",
		"That's different from the Covid-19 vaccines made using messenger RNA carried in fatty particles called lipids.",
		"They're more fragile and must be kept frozen.",
		"The two mRNA vaccines that were authorized last year in the United States -- Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna -- both use genetic material to stimulate an immune response.",
		"When the vaccine is injected in a person's arm, that genetic material gets taken up by cells in the arm muscle, which then follow the genetic instructions to make tiny pieces of the spike protein.",
		"Those little proteins stimulate an immune response, generating antibodies and immune cells that remember what they look like and that will be ready to respond quickly in case of a fresh attack.",
		"Johnson & Johnson's single-shot vaccine, which was authorized in February, uses a weakened common cold virus as a vector to carry the genetic instructions into arm cells, and they make the pieces that look like part of the coronavirus spike protein.",
		"'We were a small company' Novavax expects to apply for emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine sometime in the second quarter of this year.",
		"But the company is already manufacturing the vaccine at 10 sites in eight countries -- with two sites in the United States: North Carolina and Texas.",
		"\"They're all at different stages,\" Glenn said.",
		"\"Some are earlier, but all are up and running and working on the vaccine.",
		"So, we expect to have a very large capacity.\"",
		"Novavax's coronavirus vaccine was not among the first authorized in the United States because the company had to build the staff needed to develop such a new vaccine, Glenn said.",
		"\"We were a small company,\" he said, in comparison with some of the larger vaccine makers such as Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.",
		"\"We had to recruit people, and our funding was kind of low,\" he said.",
		"\"In addition to all the challenges of developing the vaccine, which is really complicated, we had the challenge to build a company.\"",

		"That finding was announced last month.",
		"Novavax's UK trial, with more than 15,000 participants ages 18 to 84, found that the vaccine had an efficacy of 96.4% against mild, moderate and severe disease caused by the original coronavirus strain and 86.3% against the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the United Kingdom, the company said.",
		"In their vaccine trials, Moderna saw 94.5% efficacy, Pfizer saw 95% efficacy and Johnson & Johnson 66% efficacy.",
		"However, the Novavax and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were studied later in the pandemic after researchers had identified the emergence of the coronavirus variants, compared with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines that were studied earlier.",
		"Among the vaccines, trials differed also on where they were studied, which may help explain differences in efficacy.",
		"Novavax's UK trial also showed that 14 days after the first dose, the vaccine efficacy was 83.4% in the trial, Novavax said.",
		"Novavax expects to see similar trial results in the United States -- especially as the B.1.1.7 variant continues to circulate, Glenn said.",
		"\"In the UK, the strain called B.1.1.7 became predominant and that strain looks like it is more severe in terms of causing more deaths than the original strain.",

		"The article claimed these co-conspirators could actually be FBI informants or undercover agents who infiltrated the groups, played a leading role in planning the attack, and stormed the Capitol.",
		"It's true that some indictments against members of extremist groups like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys mention anonymous co-conspirators who haven't been charged yet.",

		"Over and over, Carlson went farther than the original article with his direct and explicit claims against the FBI.",

		"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who has promoted conspiracy theories about everything from 9/11 to QAnon, re-tweeted Gaetz and suggested the \"deep state\" was involved.",

		"As it has matured, the US vaccine program has revealed geographic and demographic groups that show either high or low acceptance of the vaccine, leading to a small avalanche of speculation regarding the divergent trends.",
		"Much of the difference is being explained (complete with strong correlation coefficients) by the apparent concordance across the existing Democrat and Republican fault-line, with the ardently Republican Deep South having some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country: Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana are at the bottom of the 50 states with rates around 35-37% (compared to US rate of 54%) with Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas joining them in the bottom 10.",

		"In addition, many surveys show Democrats have been vaccinated at significantly higher rates than Republicans.",

Trump -- who has claimed himself to be the father of the vaccine and, as a vaccine recipient himself, has endorsed its use, however tepidly.",

		"Deeper in the demographics of vaccine accepters or decliners are many facts that fly in the face of the Blue-Red supposition.",
		"Take the elderly, the 65 and up crowd: 87% are at least partially vaccinated, even though they more evenly split during the 2020 election.",

		"And Black and Hispanic voters also tended to support Biden yet are less eager to be vaccinated than Whites, albeit by just a few percentage points.",

		"Covid-19 vaccine ennui is part of a much larger pattern that was evident long before 2015, when Trump descended the escalator in Trump Tower to announce his candidacy for president.",
		"But if not politics, what is driving the North-South split?",
		"It's complicated -- perhaps impossibly complicated.",
		"But an explanation may well have started many decades ago in Appalachia, which stretches across 13 states down to Alabama and Mississippi.",
		"People living there, along with the remainder of the Deep South, have had the worst rates of almost every health indicator for decades: low rates of influenza vaccination, high rates of obesity and diabetes, high rates of cigarette smoking and shorter lifespans.",

		"To some, the Covid-19 vaccines are the greatest invention by mankind of this century -- but to others, it's just more government hype, another promise certain to go nowhere, nothing but \"government manipulation.\"",
		"The explanation for the chronic poor health of people in these states -- shorter lifespan, high rates of smoking and obesity etc.",
		"-- is not that they voted for Trump.",
		"The handy trope that politics is the answer to anything and everything makes a great story but misses the point entirely.",
		"Politics simply cannot explain the facts about health outcomes in these states.",

		"But continuing to show the safety and the benefit of the Covid-19 vaccines -- using real facts -- might prove to be a productive first step.",
		"The Covid-19 pandemic dramatically revealed the inequitable delivery of American health care.",
		"Now, the Covid-19 vaccine rollout is demonstrating another open secret: public distrust in all institutions, including health care.",
		"Without sincere and sustained attention to the chronic poverty, lousy education and spotty health care in these areas, we will only see this story play again and again.",
		"OK, maybe Tommy Tuberville can help with Covid-19, but the next crisis, whatever it is, that relies on mutual trust to overcome will find itself recapitulating the same split between the haves and the have-nots -- regardless of who people voted for."
